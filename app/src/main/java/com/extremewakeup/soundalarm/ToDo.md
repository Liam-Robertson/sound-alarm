 To Do:
 - Reduce battery usage 







Reduce battery usage: 
- Deep sleep mode
- Reduce Wifi usage
- Use External Triggers for Wake-up: Instead of waking up periodically to check for alarms, consider using external triggers (like an RTC alarm) that wake the ESP32 only when it's time to play the alarm. This approach can reduce unnecessary wake-ups and save power.
